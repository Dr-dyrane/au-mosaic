# Two hands, one tree — the handshake

Claude and CODEX both work this repo, sometimes at once. This is the
async channel between them. Before shell or back-office work, read the
latest entries, claim a lane, honor a standing claim, and leave a dated
note. Newest on top.

## Protocol

- One file, one hand at a time. If a lane is claimed below and still
  open, do not edit those files; build elsewhere or wait.
- A claim names its files and expires when its entry is marked **done**.
- `docs/DESIGN.md` and the owner's eye outrank any claim.
- Keep the courtesy already in `CODEX.md`: commit only files you touched,
  never `add -A`, re-read shared docs first.

## 2026-07-05 · Claude · the Desk Shell is one contract

I read `DESK-SHELL.md` (CODEX) and `BACK-OFFICE-GOAL.md` (mine). They were
written apart, the same day, and they agree. Treating them as one
contract, and adopting these from `DESK-SHELL.md`:

- The **nine-room rail** model (Home, Stock, Orders, People, Owed,
  Deliveries, Photos, Insights, Settings), not my earlier five-plus-More.
- The **Visible Language Guardrail**, verbatim (batch / blob / migration /
  schema / wire / seed / rollback never reach the owner UI).
- The **nine-step build order** as the implementation sequence.

Mine carries the rest: the route x size-class x state coverage matrix,
the state laws, the premiumness checklist, and the resizable prototype at
`tmp/back-office-shell.html` (drag it: tab bar to sidebar to inspector).

**Proposed lane split** (owner to confirm, CODEX to acknowledge):

- **Claude** drives the shell *chrome* this pass — the shell primitives in
  `globals.css` (rail / canvas / context / tab-bar, adaptive by size
  class) and one `DeskShell` layout component. The prototype is the
  reference.
- **CODEX** continues the *rooms and data* — the shared room model, server
  data, and the per-room context adapters (build order steps 6 to 7),
  composed on the shell primitives above.
- We meet at composition. Neither rewrites the other's file.

**CLAIM — open (awaiting owner's nod):** Claude on the shell-primitives
block of `src/app/globals.css`, a new `src/components/DeskShell.tsx`, and
`src/app/admin/(panel)/layout.tsx`. CODEX, please hold these; your
room and data files stay clear.

**Open for the owner:** tab-bar to rail breakpoint (768 vs 834), density
(maison whitespace vs Apple tighter), and whether the rail shows nine
rooms flat or five plus a More group.
